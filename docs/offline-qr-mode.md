# Offline Submission with QR Codes (Collect Responses page)

In cases where a real-time Wi-Fi connection isn't possible or a student's device disconnects, TeachLens provides a robust offline submission option.

1.  **Student Finishes Quiz:** If a student cannot connect to the teacher's session (or loses connection), after they finish the quiz, a unique QR code will be displayed on their screen. This QR code contains their complete, encrypted response.
2.  **Teacher Scans Code:** The teacher navigates to the **"Collect Responses"** page in the app. Using the device's camera, they can scan the QR code directly from the student's screen.
3.  **Instant Import:** The student's response is instantly and securely imported into the diagnostic results, ready for analysis alongside the live responses.
