# 🔐 Privacy-First by Design

TeachLens is built with a core commitment to data privacy. All student data, assessments, and results are stored exclusively on the teacher's local device—no cloud databases, no central servers, and no student accounts required. Quizzes are conducted over your local Wi-Fi network, so no student information is ever uploaded to the internet. Because you provide your own AI API key and all data stays on your computer, you retain full ownership and control over your classroom data, making TeachLens a secure choice for any educational setting.
