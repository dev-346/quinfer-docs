# 🔐 Setting Up Your Password

For enhanced security, TeachLens requires you to set up a password to protect your local data. This ensures that only you can access your assessments, student responses, and analysis results.

## Initial Setup

The first time you launch TeachLens after activating your license, you will be guided through the password creation process.

1.  **Enter Your New Password:** Choose a strong, memorable password.
2.  **Confirm Your Password:** Re-enter the same password to ensure there are no typos.
3.  **Save:** Click "Set Password" to secure your account.

From then on, you will be asked to enter this password every time you open the application.

## Forgetting Your Password

If you forget your password, you can use the "Forgot Password" link on the login screen. This will require you to re-verify your original license key to reset access.

> **Important:** Your password only protects the data on your local device. It is not stored online and cannot be recovered by TeachLens support if you lose both your password and your license key.
