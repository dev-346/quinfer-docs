## A Note on Local Network Setup

For the live quiz features to work, all devices **must be connected to the same local Wi-Fi network**.

-   ✅ **Recommended Setup:** Connect the teacher's computer and all student devices to a single, stable Wi-Fi router (e.g., your school's Wi-Fi or a home router). This is the most reliable method.
-   📱 **Mobile Hotspot:** A mobile hotspot from a phone can also be used. However, some hotspots have a security feature that can prevent devices from connecting to each other. If you experience issues, this may be the cause. A portable travel router is often a great alternative in these situations.
