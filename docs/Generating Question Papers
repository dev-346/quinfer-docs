# Generating Question Papers

TeachLens allows you to quickly create professional, print-ready question papers for use as worksheets, homework assignments, or in-class tests. This guide focuses on creating a "Question Paper."

## How It Works

When you create a Question Paper, you are asking the AI to generate a set of questions based on your criteria. After generation, you can review, edit, and finalize the questions before downloading them as a PDF.

## Steps to Generate a Paper

1.  **Navigate to New Assessment:** Click on "New Assessment" in the application header or the sidebar to open the creation form.
2.  **Select Assessment Type:** Ensure **"Question Paper Generator"** is selected.
3.  **Fill out Details:** Provide the grade, subject, and topic for your Question Paper. The more specific your topic, the better the results will be (e.g., "Solving two-step linear equations" is better than "Algebra"). The more context you provide, the more accurate the generated questions will be.
4.  **Provide Content Source:**
    *   **Enter Topic:** Provide a key topic or skill.
    *   **Paste Lesson Text:** Paste content from your lesson plan for the AI to use as context.
    *   **Upload File:** Upload a pdf document for the AI to use as context.
5.  **Configure Questions:** Specify the number of questions for each type (e.g., 5 MCQs, 2 Short Answer).
6.  **Generate:** Click the **"Generate Questions"** button. The AI will create your Question Paper and take you to the "Edit Assessment" screen.
7.  **Review and Download:** On the "Edit Assessment" screen, you can make changes to any question. Once you're satisfied, click the "Download PDFs" button to save the question paper and a worksheet version to your computer.

## Finding Your Papers Later

All Question Paper you create are automatically saved in your **Test Bank**, which you can access from the application header or the sidebar. From the Test Bank, you can open, edit, re-download, or delete any of your past question papers.
