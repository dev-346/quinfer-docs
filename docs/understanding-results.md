# Understanding the Results

## Teacher: View Live Results & Analyze

1.  **Receive Responses:** As students submit, their responses will appear on your results page in real-time. The dashboard will show you how many students have responded.
2.  **Analyze Results:** Once you have enough responses, click the **"Analyze Results"** button. The AI will perform a deep analysis of the answers. The page will update with a full breakdown, including:
    *   **Teaching Decision Status:** A clear, color-coded recommendation on what to do next (e.g., 🔴 Reteach Required, 🟡 Practice Required, 🟢 Move On).
    *   **Primary Learning Concern:** A plain-language explanation of the biggest conceptual misunderstanding in the class.
    *   **Question-by-Question Insights:** A breakdown of each question, showing common wrong answers and an AI-powered insight into *why* students made those errors.
    *   **Student Grouping:** Students are automatically clustered into groups like "Concept Rebuild" or "Guided Practice," allowing for easy differentiated instruction.
3.  **Generate Follow-ups:** Use the "Action Center" on the results page to generate a customized **Reteaching Plan** or an **Adaptive Follow-up Quiz** that targets the identified weak areas.
