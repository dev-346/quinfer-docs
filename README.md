# 📘 TeachLens

TeachLens is a smart classroom decision-support app designed for teachers. It helps teachers quickly create assessments, run diagnostic quizzes, and understand exactly where students are struggling — without complex analytics or manual analysis.

TeachLens acts like a teaching assistant: it analyzes student responses, detects learning gaps, highlights misconceptions, and recommends clear next steps such as practice, review, or reteaching. All data is stored locally, quizzes can run over a local network, and student privacy is fully maintained — no cloud dependency required.

In short, TeachLens helps teachers see their class clearly and teach with confidence.

### 🧭 Philosophy Behind TeachLens
TeachLens is not an LMS. It is not a grading tool.

It is a **teaching awareness system**.

> “Marks tell you who is weak.
> TeachLens tells you why — and what to do next.”
