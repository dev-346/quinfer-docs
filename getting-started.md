# 📘 Getting Started with TeachLens

TeachLens is a smart classroom decision-support app designed for teachers. It helps teachers quickly create assessments, run diagnostic quizzes, and understand exactly where students are struggling — without complex analytics or manual analysis.

TeachLens acts like a teaching assistant: it analyzes student responses, detects learning gaps, highlights misconceptions, and recommends clear next steps such as practice, review, or reteaching.

## 🌱 Why TeachLens?
Teaching often involves making fast decisions with limited visibility. Teachers may know that students are struggling, but not why, where, or what to do next.

TeachLens solves this by turning assessment responses into clear instructional signals.

Instead of raw scores and percentages, TeachLens provides:

- Clear teaching decisions (Move On, Practice Required, Review Suggested, Reteach Required)
- Identified learning gaps and misconceptions
- Actionable recommendations for the next lesson
- Student grouping for reteaching, practice, or enrichment

This allows teachers to spend less time analyzing and more time teaching.

## 👩‍🏫 Who TeachLens Is For

-   School teachers
-   Private tutors
-   Coaching institutes
-   Educators seeking data-informed teaching
-   Teachers who want clarity, not complexity
